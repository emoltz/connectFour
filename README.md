# Connect Four
This project's purpose is to get me more comfortable with jQuery. I will build a working Connect Four game with HTML, javascript, and jQuery.

I set up a very basic connect 4 board using tables in HTML and formatting with CSS, based on a UDEMY course for jQuery. I am making the javascript logic now and will figure out how to utilize jquery further to make it all work. I am also using Bootstrap 5 to make things easier on the front-end.
