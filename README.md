# Connect Four
This project's purpose is to get me more comfortable with jQuery. I will build a working Connect Four game with HTML, javascript, and jQuery.

I set up a very basic connect 4 board using tables in HTML and formatting with CSS, based on a UDEMY course for jQuery. I am making the javascript logic now and will figure out how to utilize jquery further to make it all work. I am also using Bootstrap 5 to make things easier on the front-end. 

Got it fully working. Not too difficult actually. Used jQuery to change the color values of the board and also to reset it. Very useful! Also added a glow animation when the game is over to press the button at the bottom.

Made it mobile ready, which is great! All the logic seems to be working well. I'd like to add animations at some point but I'm not sure how to do that right now.
